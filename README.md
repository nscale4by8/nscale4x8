## Prototype Inspiration

I am loosely modeling the Clevelan Flats from around 1960. I seleted the prototype location for the opportunity to model densely packed industries and a complex web of rails. The prototype includes grades with over and under passes, level crossings, and multiple lift bridges.

## Track Plan

The plan is inspired by the famouse [Atlas Granite Gorge & Northern](https://www.modeltrainforum.com/picture.php?albumid=241&pictureid=2492). I adapted it to support more continuous run variations as well as opportunities for local switching on sidings while other trains run continuously.
