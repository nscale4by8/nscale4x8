Prototype (Cleveland Flats) I am loosely modeling the Cleveland Flats from around 1960. I selected the prototype location for the opportunity to model densely packed industries and a complex web of rails. The prototype includes grades with over and under passes, level crossings, and multiple lift bridges.  |   ![Turnout at Lift Bridge](toc/tocTurnoutAtLiftBridge.png)
