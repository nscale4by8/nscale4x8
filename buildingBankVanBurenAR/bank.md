A post at [Model Railroad Hobbiest MRH Forum](https://forum.mrhmag.com/post/interesting-prototype-structure-library-12629898?trail=275) contains many images of prototype structures. [One in particular](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/pnp/mrg/04000/04046v.jpg) sparked my interest. I don't have any place to put the structure on my current layout, but it's still cool to model and print it.

I make test prints to refine the 3D models and dil in the printer settings to get the level of detail I want. The third test print has correctly sized brick details, shingles on the third floor facade, plus edges and notches that will serve as interlocking components when the structure is assembled. I can usualy achive tilerances that allow the parts to stick together without glue. Howevre, when glue is used, it's improtant to have enough surface area for the glue joint. The edges and notches also assure alignment of the separate parts during assembly.
